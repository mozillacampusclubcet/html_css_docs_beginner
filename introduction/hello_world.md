# Hello World

In your path towards learning the basics of web especially HTML5 and CSS3, this documentation will prove helpful hopefully.

Learning the web is quite an easy task but requires continous dedication, passion and patience. So if you don't grasp a concept at first, try it again.

Learning the basics of web can only be complete if you understand the basics of web. [Start learning here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work).

To be honest, we believe in the concept of "learning by doing". So you don't have to read all this documentation at first but do something in this field and you will end up learning everything easily. :)
