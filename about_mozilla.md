# About Mozilla

Mozilla is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1998 by members of Netscape. The Mozilla community uses, develops, spreads and supports Mozilla products, thereby promoting exclusively free software and open standards, with only minor exceptions. The community is supported institutionally by the Mozilla Foundation and its tax-paying subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.

Mozilla's products include the Firefox web browser, Thunderbird e-mail client, Firefox OS mobile operating system, Bugzilla bug tracking system, Gecko layout engine and others. During 2017, Mozilla acquired Pocket, a "read-it-later-online" service.

## Mozilla Campus Clubs

The vision for Campus Clubs is to spark a movement -- a loud voice, a breeding ground for new ideas, a massive force, a deep talent pool -- that powers the open web to new heights.

At the start of each year, Campus Clubs plan the impact they want to have for the open web and then hack and build on a combination of recommended activities and their own open source projects to make a difference for the web, their campuses and communities.
